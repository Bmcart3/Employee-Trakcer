# Employee-Trakcer
Command line application that allows the user to interact with a database of employees. 
Uses a self made database seeded with 9 employees to show the functionality of the app. The user is prompted via inquirer to determine what version of the employee table they would like to see. They also have the ability to add a new employee or alter an existing one.
This was a very challenging project and there will be continued effort put in to improve it's functionality.
